                "It's fun how hard the Miniknog tries to paint themselves as good to the rest of the galaxy; everybody knows the truth.",
                "Spreading the truth about the Miniknog is the way I fight them, and the only way I can support my fellow countrymen.",
                "The Miniknog puts things to their water, it makes the apex forget things.",
                "Being a courier was the only way I could get fun despite being a dangerous job.",
                "I remember being a rebel for a time, living hiding, with fear the Miniknog would take me, I eventually left behind that life.",
                "Sometimes I feel remorse of leaving the Rebellion, it feels as if the Miniknog had won over me.",
                "I'm glad the Protectorate helps all the refugiees who flee from the Miniknog, but I wish they could do more.",

                "If you ever read something on the Daily Peel, don't believe it!",

                "Space is really cool, I wish the Miniknog would teach it in a more cool way too.",
                "The Protectorate is really different in comparison to the Miniknog.",
                "It's really weird how the Miniknog barely teach us about the Protectorate.",

                "The amount of times some protectors recklessly jump to a planet are surprising",
                "My family wanted me to be an Envoy, but I wouldn't stand to be years away from home",
                "What happened to Earth... I still can't comprenhend it",
                "It's curious, people are prone to search more for peace and not for conflict",
                "It's fun to travel in space, you get to know a lot of people.",
                "Sometimes I want to go home, but I really like it here",
                "The Protectorate won't dissapear, or I hope it won't",
                "If there's something I don't like about the Protectorate are the rations, they are dry!",
                "Thank goodness we don't do paperwork like the Peacekeepers, I would had gone crazy!",
                "To be a protector is to wait a lot of time, it can get a bit boring",
                "I feel kinda jealous of Envoys, they get a lot of attention!",
                "I'm glad the Protectorate exists, things had been better thanks to them.",
                "Truth be said, Protectorate rations aren't that good",
                "Have you ever seen a big fly in astronaut gear? Sounds crazy but believe me, those exist...",
                "There are tales of mysterious ships always following anyone, do you believe those? I don't.",
                "It's incredible to think that even to this point there are things we don't know about space.",
                "Be watchful of bandits, they are highly problematic.",
                "I wish the Protectorate could do something about bandits increasing their numbers since years.",
                "Had you heard anything about the Goshawks? I had heard horrible things, I hope they aren't truth.",
                "It's amazing all the support we had received from other people, the Protectorate isn't going anywhere!",
                "I don't like being called a \"Remnant of the Protectorate\", I refuse to believe I'm a leftover of sort.",

                "Goshawks? I had heard about them, I don't think they're as ruthless as people paint them",
                "Everything you had heard about the Restless is unfounded; well, mostly...",
                "There are wild stories about space adventurers, my advice? don't put yourself at risk.",
                "I once heard about a extreme sport consisting of submerging into lava for the longest time you could, how is that even a sport?",
                "Be careful where you travel, bandits are opportunists and they could be everywhere.",
                "If I had to fight space bandits? Kinda, I mean, they ran before I could pull out a weapon.",
                "I feel sorry for Peacekeepers, they have to deal with the obnoxious bandits.",
                "We like to roast bandits a lot, but don't get confused, they're still dangerous.",
                "I like to be a Protector, you know a lot of places, people and food!",
                "The most beautiful place in the galaxy? Ah, that's a tough one.",
                "I wouldn't stand to be an Envoy, they live far away from home and for many years, I really respect them for that.",
                "Rescue missions wouldn't be such a yoke to bear if people were more cautious.",
                "Be careful with celestial interferences, sometimes not-very-nice people hide behind those.",
                "Regular bandits are usually a nuissance, but Goshawks? Now that's something to really worry about.",
                "In all the years I had been in space I've never seen \"rocks with faces\" being alive, the nonsense!",
                "For the amount of u-s-c-m stuff we find you wouldn't believe they simply stopped existing.",
                "Things out of ordinary? in space? Trust me, if your whole life has been on a planet, everything in space looks out of ordinary.",
                "The nicest Florans you will meet out there are the Restless, some will try to eat you yes, but that number is very low.",
                "There's a weird notion that the Protectorate has dissapeared, what are we if so?",
                "I wish people still recognizes us as the Protectorate and not as the \"Remnants\", it has a weird ring.",
                "Lets be real, we are indeed Remnants of the Protectorate, but we are still the Protectorate.",
                "We had received a lot of support from different communities around the galaxy, really amazing!",
                "We need all the support we can get, if you want to help us it would be cool.",
                "You look kinda hungry, you want some food?",
                "Those are some gruesome scars, where had you been into?",
                "You're a space traveler right? Would you like to tell me some crazy story of yours?",
                "You look like you need some spare pixels.",
                "Oh, you're a space traveler? They're cool people, they have all sort of stories to tell.",
                "I just want to say that you have a cool outfit.",
                "Don't get me wrong, your outfit is good, but it can be better.",
                "That outfit is rad, but wouldn't you like to have a Protectorate outfit?",
                "Hey, how truth are the things people say about the Goshawks? Are they that terrible?",
                "Remember to always travel through safe space routes, there are dangers out there.",
                "If you always feel like taking vacations you can go to one of those cozy space hotels.",
                "Occasus? I had heard a couple of things, like they caused the destruction of Earth, not even they believe it.",
                "Oh, damned be that day when Protectorate rations are the only thing left to eat.",
                "It would be great if you have some goods to spare with us, we really need them.",
                "I love all kind of planets, but Lush planets are my favorite of them all.",
                "I had been on moons before, they have a very eerie atmosphere if you ask me.",
                "You know what's cool about space? That there will always be something more to discover!",
                "It feels nice to help people, but I wish space travelers would get into problems less often.",
