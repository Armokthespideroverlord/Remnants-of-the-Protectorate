# Remnants of the Protectorate
This is a work-in-progress. The objective of the mod is to expand and add new lore regarding the Protectorate. New Furniture, new cosmetic sets, new codex and dungeons and all that stuff.

# To do list
__MOD SUPPORT__
- Spawnable Item Pack
- Wardrobe Interface
- Planet Search
- More Planet Info
- Better Crew
- Scripted SAIL
- Maybe a full SAIL replacement addon?
- Make an extra addon for crewmembers so they can wear their unique outfits.
- Many Tabs (particularly adding a dedicated Protectorate category for the codex).

__GENERAL:__
- Fix the antennae of the second middle sections of the Protectorate Ship.
- Complete the Envoy ship (add more parts; add npcs).

__NPCS__
- Revamp dialogue for all custom npcs.
- Make a Protectorate Ship Turret.
   - Make it fire a beam (or few) instead of projectiles?
