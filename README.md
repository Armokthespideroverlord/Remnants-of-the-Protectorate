# Remnants of the Protectorate
Welcome! This is the official Github page for Starbound mod "Remnants of the Protectorate", a small content expansion that aims to expand on the few bits of lore around the Terrene Protectorate from a "worldbuilding" angle. You'll be able to find new dungeons, furniture items, clothing outfits, friendly npcs, brand-new codexes and more! Currently a work-in-progress (getting closer to the 0.1 release version!!!).

# Mod Support
This mod has in-built support for other mods, like Spawnable Item Pack, Wardrobe Interface, Planet Search, Book of Spirits, Erisss' More Planet Info and Better Crew; we are aiming for even more compatibily!

Here's also a couple of mod recommendations to play with that fit nice with Remnants: Protectorate Themed Blocks, either Protector icons or Starbound Patch Project mostly for the icons (although I do recomend having both) and Project Redemption (as some parts of the Lore presented by Remnants were inspired by the additions of PR)

# Credits
Armok - A huge shoutout to him for being a good friend in general, for doing a lot of helpful writing corrections to my descriptions, codexes and dialogues and giving me a lot of interesting ideas and helpful feedback.
Pixelflame - Also a huge shoutout to her for spriting what would be the final version of the Protectorate Astraeus logo.
