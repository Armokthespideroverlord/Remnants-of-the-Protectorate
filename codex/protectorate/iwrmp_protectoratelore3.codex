  "The Protector, the backbone of the Protectorate itself; its significance may be understated given how the galaxy has become used to its presence for decades and decades, and yet, how important they are, actually? What do they do?
Protectors are any people who, under the wing of the Protectorate, are trained under a set of tenets, by which they solemnly swear to maintain unity and peace throughout the galaxy.",

"All Protectors are trained to be masterful mediators and problem-solvers. They receive combat training too; however, this only remains as a last resource when diplomacy has failed. Other than this, the role of the Protector is surprisingly very versatile. They can be assigned to rescue teams in the far quadrants of the galaxy; to humanitarian missions in distant planets and even they participate in settlement projects and education programs for isolated communities.",

"While the Envoys explore the far-off quadrants of space to lay down the path for the Protectorate, the Protectors themselves are the ones tasked to maintain this path and help everybody in it.
You can be sure that, if you are ever in need of help, even in the most dire conditions, there will always be a Protector there to help you."
