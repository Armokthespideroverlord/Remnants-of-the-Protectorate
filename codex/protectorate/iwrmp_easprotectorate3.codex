  "This is Captain Obinata of the AES Argonaut ship, representing the 04th Division under the 21st Astraeus Fleet.//
As you may know, all long-communications are down, and a peculiar yet alarming distress signal from Earth has reached you or is about to.//
Due to the confusion provoked by said signal is that the closest Divisions to Earth are preparing for a scouting mission to inspect the Sol System.//",
  
"To avoid any chaos, we're asking all remaining Divisions to be in standby while the rest of us are scouting the zone around Earth.//
Once our mission has concluded we shall return to broadcast you the current situation on Earth and discuss what should be done regarding the 21st Astraeus Mission.//
If you can, we ask you to retransmit this message and reach the farthest Divisions. Captain Obinata Out.//"
