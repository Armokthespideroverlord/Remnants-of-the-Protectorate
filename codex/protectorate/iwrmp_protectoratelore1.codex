  "One of the goals of the Protectorate was to explore space beyond what was already known, otherwise, how would they achieve their goals of aiding the galaxy without knowing it?
The Astraeus Program was a first step towards that, as its missions revealed new planets and communities far away to contact and help; however, how to efficiently help them was the challenge in question. The answer wasn't that far off for them.",

"Before exploring out, the Protectorate established a set of space stations in strategical points so they could answer any emergency swiftly. They decided to set this approach and establish space stations which could aid multiple communities at the same time, if they asked for.
With some extra outposts and satellites to cut the communication gap, along constant supply chains, is that the Protectorate Network arises to be what nowadays is.",

"Since then, the Protectorate operates in a big network of pivotal locations and ship routes that encompasses countless quadrants and planets. The Protectorate is able to send rescue teams, humanitarian help, diplomats and more to the far reaches of the galaxy, and the Network has served as a cornerstone for reaching such achievements."
