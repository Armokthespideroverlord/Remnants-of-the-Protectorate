Oh, I'm sorry for you I suppose, because you wouldn't be there if you are here... Anyways, no hard feelings right? Don't worry, we got the finest entertainment of any habitat in the galaxy, you like Numi-related movies, right?",

"Right, the Biosphere! You don't have to worry; we have a good record of sending our reports in time and handling very well the few malfunctions we had. We did a double check of everything and everything is good! Except for the supplies, they are kinda low? We were supposed to fill a request for more, I guess you can do that. Anyway, everything is on check, all is fine, send your reports, bla bla bla, you know the rest. Have fun!"
