  "The Protector, the backbone of the Protectorate itself; their significance may be understated given how the galaxy has become used to their presence for decades and longer, and yet, how important are they, actually? And what do they do?
Protectors are any people who, as members of the Protectorate, are trained under a set of tenets, by which they solemnly swear to maintain unity and peace throughout the galaxy.",

"All Protectors are trained to be masterful mediators and problem-solvers. They receive combat training too; however, this only remains as a last resort when diplomacy has failed, or to protect those in need. Other than that, the role of the Protector is surprisingly very versatile. They can be assigned to rescue teams in the far quadrants of the galaxy; to humanitarian missions in distant planets and even participate in settlement projects and education programs for isolated communities.",

"In addition, Protectors always carry their distinctive insignia tool: the Matter Manipulator. Styled after the \"Wings of Peace\", the Matter Manipulator allows its user to reform matter at their own will; and it's with this tool that Protectors can create and build anything they and others could need at a moment. This tool carries such significance, as it represents the ability to create a better future for everyone.",

"While the Envoys explore the far-off quadrants of space to lay down a path for the Protectorate to walk through, the Protectors themselves are the ones tasked to maintain this path and help everybody along it.
You can be sure that if you are ever in need of help, even in the most dire conditions, there will always be a Protector there to help you."
