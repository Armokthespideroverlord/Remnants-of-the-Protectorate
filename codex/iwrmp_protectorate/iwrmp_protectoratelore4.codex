  "There are many exciting events for us this year: the 500th anniversary on the foundation of the Protectorate, the graduation of a new generation of Protectors and Envoys, and the Return of the 21st Astraeus Mission and the beginning of the 22nd. Let it be said this will not be like any other anniversary celebration!",

"Our mandataries back on Earth are thinking of making a celebration of the three events as one single big event in the span of at least three weeks! It will begin with a parade of the 22nd Astraeus Fleet, then the Graduation Ceremony at the end of the first week, followed then by the return of the 21st Astraeus Mission at the end of the second one, and then concluding with the parting of the 22nd Astraeus Fleet at the end of the third week.",

"That's quite a lot, isn't it? That's why the event has been announced months in advance so everybody, including you, can make proper preparations for the event! Do not miss what might just be one of the most celebrated events in the galaxy! Here's to 500 more years of the Protectorate, and beyond!"
