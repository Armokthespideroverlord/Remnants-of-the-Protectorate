Litus Cradle II. We were informed that the planet suffered a couple of cold summers when a particularly big volcano unleashed a massive cloud of ash all over the planet. Biomes started to perish, and a Protectorate mission was launched to help the planet. Despite arriving at a point where the emergency has passed, we didn't prevent ourselves from supporting the Protectors planetside.",

"I got the idea of naming the planet Celarus. It was the name of my grandfather; he sadly passed away before this mission. I felt a bit of remorse not getting to stay longer, but this is the least I can do. I didn't tell that to the crew, just that it was a typical Avian name, they didn't think much of it. Truth be told, I felt compelled to do it just by seeing the beautiful sights on the planet, they seem to shine with a newfound vitality. The naming request has been sent.",

"Log Entry #207, Year 7 – Astraeus Mission XXI

Well, now it has been two years since we arrived. Global temperatures are stabilizing, and I know our presence is not required anymore. What a wonderful two years! This planet is filled with monumental forests, ever-blue oceans and breathtaking sunsets; there's a lot of curious critters here and there. And the name got approved! Now it's officially called Celarus. The Protectorate has saved Celarus. He would have loved this place, that's for sure.",

"We are now leaving to continue with our exploration. It will probably be the last time I see Celarus again. It's odd, I feel like a part of me wants to stay on the planet forever. But we always have to part ways, no matter how much we don't want to. We always have to say farewell to each other, don't we? Then, farewell Celarus! I hope your name can live on forever, as long as the immortal stars. I'll be gone in a mere century, but you'll be here, for eons to come."
