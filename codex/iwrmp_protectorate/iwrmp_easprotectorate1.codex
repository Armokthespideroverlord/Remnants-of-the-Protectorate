  "^gray;This message has been written and distributed by the remnants of the Protectorate Network. This is not a test.^reset; 
  
Days ago, a SOS broadcast has been received from Earth warning of its destruction, and by extension, the destruction of the Protectorate at the hands of an unknown force. This coincides with the sudden fall of our communications network across the galaxy. Whichever rumors you have heard are true: the Protectorate has collapsed. However, it's not fully gone.",

"In these moments, across the galaxy, many surviving Protectors remain along with the 21st Astreus Mission fleet, and we are determined to continue with our duties and be in service of the galaxy. But the reconstruction won't be easy, we'll need all help we can get, even yours.

This is a call to every citizen of the galaxy who are willing to volunteer in the reconstruction and help us in these dire moments. Whichever skills you have are welcomed.",

"We encourage you to locate a near Protectorate outpost or Protector to be in further contact.

If you're a Protector reading this message, do not fault; we are still here. If you're lost, you can be sure that we can find you, and you can find us. Civilian or Protector, take the contents of this pod so you can help yourself and even help others.

Be safe and good luck."
