We arrived at the third planet of the Australis Ridge system, a lush planet with some rather large forests. Some of the trees are particularly big, ranging from 60 to 80 meters long. The air is thankfully breathable and non-dangerous for us, so there is no need for masks or oxygen tanks. The terrain tends to get slightly steep, so it's not easy to walk.",

"After a couple of days exploring we found a Deadbeat community in the middle of the forest. They were very cautious, and a bit unexpected, but we were able to communicate our intentions, and they let us stay. From what we could gather, they arrived in a now wrecked ship, they crashed into the forest and the few that survived decided to live here. There have been at least two new generations, so it was quite a while.",

"They seem to be very chill, and they talk with a sort of reverence to the forest, particularly the elderly. Given how many Deadbeats live out there, I get it. I never thought about how lucky I was to live on a green and thriving planet. We offered support from the Protectorate, and while they seemed unsure at first, they thought about it and accepted. We are going to return in a couple of hours and propose them for us to stay longer and study their situation, I hope they accept."
