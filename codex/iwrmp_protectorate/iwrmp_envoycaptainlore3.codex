  "^yellow;Log Entry #364, Year 9 – Astraeus Mission XXI^reset;
  
It's New Year! We throwed a little celebration between all the crew, Rimu as always shows to be an amazing cook. Everything is also ready for our return to Earth, one year of travel! Adam and I have a lot of plans of what to do once we return to Earth; for once, taking a well-deserved rest, we are not exactly young anymore haha. Anyhow, that's all I have to report for today! Captain out.",

"^yellow;Log Entry #364, Year 10 – Astraeus Mission XXI^reset;

A bit closer to Earth! Just another half year of travel and we should be received by the biggest celebration ever made! All our crew is crazy with plans and expectations. Adam and I decided to move to a cozy field and just put our house close to one of those calm towns, after a life of adventures the least we could have is just a peaceful life. I'm not exactly fond of the countryside but I'll be open to it.",

"^yellow;Log Entry #190 – Days after Earth's incident^reset;

We were in disbelief for a while. We thought it was a prank, but then days passed, and reports came and went. Yesterday, for the first time, we cried. Many of us were expecting our families, Adam is feeling desperate, I tried to stay calm with the crew, but I cried too. I haven't cried in years, I forgot the sound of my own sadness. We are just waiting for news, and new orders perhaps.",

"^yellow;Log Entry #209^reset;

I guess our plans for a good rest will wait. We received orders to help a Protectorate outpost in the Hind system. The crew seems to have regained some of their optimism, perhaps our new work keeps them distracted. We are still sad, but the fact that many of us are still here seems to be a good motivation to keep going on. Hmm, I didn't think about it, Adam and I could live on another planet. I'll be looking forward to that idea. Captain out."
