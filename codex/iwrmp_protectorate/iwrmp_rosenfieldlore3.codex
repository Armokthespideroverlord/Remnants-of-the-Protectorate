  "PRESERVATION

There will be cases where the damage an environment has suffered is so deep and irreversible that any effort put into restoring it will be useless. The Preservation approach should only be undergone if our diagnosis of an environment's health forecasts its inevitable decline and extinction. Documentation of the afflicted environment must be as comprehensive as possible in such an event.",

"What actions entail \"preservation\" must always be directed to find a solution in which an environment is able to physically exist, even if in isolation or beyond its place of origin. Scientists around the galaxy have been able to find a fruitful solution to this problem in the form of arks; I forsee a future where we have the technology to emulate endangered environments in highly specialized structures, artificially managed habitats if I speculate.",

"If we cannot do such tasks, if the inevitable end of an environment is impossible to stop and our efforts to build artificial habitats or arks fail, then it's our duty to at least preserve their memory. The last phase of this approach would be a full documentation of all its elements and relationships; Envoy ships must have enough equipment to document and preserve these memories, allowing us to make faithful reconstructions in the future. Such are the ways of Preservation."
