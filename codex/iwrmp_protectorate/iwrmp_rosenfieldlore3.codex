  "PRESERVATION

There will be cases where the damage an environment has suffered is so deep and irreversible that any effort put into restoring it might be useless. The Preservation approach shall only be pushed if our diagnostic of an environment's health forecasts its inevitable decline and disappearance. Documentation of the afflicted environment must reach deep levels of comprehension.",

"What actions entail \"preservation\" must always be directed to find a solution in which an environment is able to physically exist, even if in isolation or beyond its place of origin. Scientists around the galaxy have been able to find a charitable solution to this problem in the form of arks; I think of a future where we have the technology to emulate endangered environments in highly specialized places, artificially managed habitats if I'm allowed to speculate.",

"If we cannot do such tasks, if the inevitable end of an environment is impossible to stop and our efforts to build artificial habitats or arks fail, then it's our duty to at least preserve its memory. The last phase of this approach would be a deep documentation of all its elements and relationships; Envoy ships must have enough equipment to document and preserve these memories, allowing us to make faithful reconstructions in the future. Such are the ways of Preservation."
