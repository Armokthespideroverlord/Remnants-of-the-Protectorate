  "The Envoy is probably one of the most important roles alongside the one of the Protector.
While they share some similar tenets, they carry out different activities and have different priorities.
For instance, the Envoy is more focused on space exploration, scientific research and environmental protection. Sometimes they carry out diplomatic activities too. Their training is slightly longer than the one of Protectors, with a focus on the pragmatic side of things.",

"Like Protectors, they must be able to contact and mediate with unidentified communities and be able to defuse conflicts through peaceful means (combat being only a last resource). In plus of this, an Envoy must know a variety of skills that could lead them to survive in the wilderness of unexplored planets. Very often an Envoy is also specialized in a field of science of their own choice. In other words, they are explorers, diplomats and researchers, all in one!",

"Depending on the species, most Envoys get to participate in either 2 or 3 missions in all their lifetime (in average).
It may sound discouraging, but one mission alone is full of unique experiences for those who wish to explore and see what space waits for them. Thanks to Envoys, the purpose of the Protectorate can and has been achieved throughout centuries."
