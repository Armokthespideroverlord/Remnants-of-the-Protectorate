  "In the troubled history of Mankind, Humans had to face the possibility of ecological collapse on a global scale, so it's not a coincidence that Humanity would be interested in making a more positive impact on nature in modern times. It's interesting to see the creation of the Gaia Program given that nature preservation is not exactly a concern for the Protectorate; we can see that it's in the interest of Humans to help and preserve the ecosystems of other planets however.",

"The Gaia Program would really come late in the history of the Protectorate, by the time that the 11th Astraeus Mission was being planned, it was obvious that many planets out there were facing natural and artificial disasters. That's not to say that before the Gaia Program the Protectorate didn't take any action; in fact, a lot of the actions to protect the environments of other planets were directed by what was known as the Rosenfield Plan before the Gaia Program came.",

"The Rosenfield Plan, developed by the genius Human protector Arthur Rosenfield, was a series of protocols regarding which approach to take in case of encountering an endangered environment: the Restoration approach, or the Preservation approach. It wasn't exactly official Protectorate guideline, so the creation of the Gaia Program had the purpose of officializing it and making it a pillar of the Protectorate for the rest of time."
