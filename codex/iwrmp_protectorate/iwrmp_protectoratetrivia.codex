-Astraeus SAIL units, unlike regular ones, are programmed to be more cheerful and casual in their interactions, that way Envoys feel less alone!

-Astraeus ships don't transport prefabricated buildings, instead, they use Lupton units to storage building materials. It also uses the same technology as the Matter Manipulator!",

"-Older versions of the Matter Manipulator were incredibly big. As Pocket Universe tech got better, Matter Manipulators started to be smaller. The oldest one recorded was the size of a house!

-The 21st Astraeus Mission was delayed by ten years to coincide with the launch of the 22nd Astraeus fleet along its renovated spaceship fleet. Only 2 years left!",

"-Watchers must endure extra 4 years of discipline and education! After all, their job is to be as stoic and reasonable under pressure as possible, and they are good at that!

-The Arch of Peace, the name of the Terrene Protectorate logo, actually predates the formation of the Protectorate! It was a sign of peace and progress long before now.",

"-The Protectorate Network spans over thousands of systems! Isn't it impressive how humans can manage everything from Earth?

-Maybe not for too long! Grand Protector Leda Portia has said there is interest for opening a new Protectorate Academy in the Hylotl Homeworld! It's still in discussions, so let's hope it happens!
