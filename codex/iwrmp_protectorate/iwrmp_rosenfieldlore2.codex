  "RESTORATION

To label an environment as in need of a restoration approach we need to have a deep understanding of said environments. All preliminary actions before the restoration shall be to document and understand the complex ecology of the environment affected. On top of these actions, there has to be an understanding of the factors that are causing ecological disequilibrium in said environments.",

"Which actions entail a \"restoration\" of an environment may vary according to the case. It may be the case that an animal species fills a crucial ecological niche and is in decline, our role there would be to help said species grow in numbers yet again. Another case would be the pollution produced by an industrial complex close to the environment; the course of action there is clear: to relocate and dismantle the industrial complex so it stops polluting the environment.",

"The restoration implies that an endangered environment, no matter how dire the situation can be, is in the possibility to regain its health, either by direct action or by taking away external factors. Since our diagnostic of an environment's health depends on our own comprehension of it, Envoy ships shall employ biologists and ecologists, they shall also be fitted with enough equipment to make laboratory tests of all the elements of the environment. Such are the ways of Restoration."
