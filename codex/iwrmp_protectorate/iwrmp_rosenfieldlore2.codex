  "RESTORATION

To label an environment as in need of the restoration approach we need to have a proper understanding of said environment. All preliminary actions before restoration should be to document and understand the complex ecology of the environment affected. On top of these actions, there must also be an understanding of what factors are causing ecological disequilibrium in said environments.",

"What actions entail the \"restoration\" of an environment may vary according to the case. It may be the case that an animal species fills a crucial ecological niche and is in decline, our role there would be to help said species grow in numbers yet again. Another case would be the pollution produced by an abandoned industrial complex within the environment; the course of action there is clear: to relocate or dismantle the industrial complex so it stops polluting the environment.",

"Restoration implies that an endangered environment, no matter how dire the situation may be, holds the possibility to regain its health, either by direct action or by mitigating external factors. Since our diagnosis of an environment's health depends on our own comprehension of it, Envoy ships shall employ biologists and ecologists, who will also be fitted with enough equipment to make laboratory tests on all elements of the environment. Such are the ways of Restoration."
