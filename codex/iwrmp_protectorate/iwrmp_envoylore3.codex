  "Even before the Protectorate was created, humanity had a long record of establishing diplomatic relations with all the species closer to Earth; they studied their languages, their cultures, and customs to interact properly with the rest of the galaxy. With the creation of the Protectorate and the Astraeus Program, the logical next step was to also create a program that would oversee the establishing of proper relationships with all the newly discovered settlements. That was the purpose of the Hermes Program.",

"This is where we can see the first big influx of volunteers from other species to collaborate with the Protectorate, as it attracted a lot of the attention of many curious scholars and explorers. The Hermes Program has since been vital to creating a sense of belonging and unity among species typically known to be societally fragmented, like the Glitch and the Novakids. It even made some species like the Florans and the Avians aware of the drastic cultural differences between each of their settlements across space.",

"The Hermes Program is one of the pillars of the Protectorate. It has favored the idea that to establish peace in the galaxy, it is important to deeply know it not only on a scientific level but also in a cultural one; knowing this has made possible to see the different points of tension and cooperation between species, and with that, the creation of strategies to bring diplomacy to greater and more effective heights."
