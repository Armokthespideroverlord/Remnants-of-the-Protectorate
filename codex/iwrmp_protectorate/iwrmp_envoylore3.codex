  "Even before the Protectorate was created, humanity had a long record of stablishing diplomatic relations with all the species and their settlements closer to Earth; they studied their languages, their cultures and costumes to interact properly with the rest of the galaxy. With the creation of the Protectorate and the Astraeus Program, the logical step was to also create a program that would oversee the stablishing of proper relationships with all new discovered settlements. That was the purpose of the Hermes Program.",

"This is where we can see the first big affluent of voluntaries from other species to collaborate with the Protectorate, as it attracted a lot the attention of many scholars and curious explorers. The Hermes Program has been vital to create a sense of belonging and union in species typically known to be societally fragmented, like the Glitch and the Novakids. It even made some species like the Floran and the Avians aware of the drastic cultural differences between each of their settlement across space.",

"The Hermes Program is one of the pillars of the Protectorate. It has favored the idea that to stablish peace in the galaxy is important to deeply know it not only on a scientific level but also in a cultural one; knowing these differences made possible to see the points of tension and collaboration between species, and with that, the creation of strategies to take diplomacy to higher and more effective levels."
