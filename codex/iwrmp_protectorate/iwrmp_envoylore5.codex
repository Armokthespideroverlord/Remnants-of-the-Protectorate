Sseventh day on the job, Beatu is truly happy about this... uhm, journey! I guess that's the word. Crew is happy too, Beatu knows it has been only a few days, and there are still 19 yearss left. There's something Beatu has been thinking about since ship sailed away and it's about the stories about weird vessels that follow some captains sometimess.",

"Beatu remembers a story that old Riversong told many years ago; about how while they were flying their ship to register a new system, a very curious vessel appeared on the distance. The old robot said that the vessel looked like a metal sphere, very rusty, very weird. Riversong was very alert, and they swore that at some point the ship was like dozens of meterss close! It was a very stressful moment for Riversong, but in the end just one of many tales to tell.",

"Other old captainss have storiess like that one too, they always been fasscinating. Beatu feels like would be scared if I saw a vessel like that too, but honestly it would be a very good story to tell when I'm old too. Doess it sound bad if Beatu wishes to encounter something spooky like that? Beatu hopesss it is not the case."
